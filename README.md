# Project14

### Project Description

This Project is my extension to Project14 from 100 Days of Swift by Paul Hudson: github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift/tree/main/Classic/project14.

During this Game you have to hit proper pinguins to score the highest result.
If you lose 3 lives or the 50 rounds elipse the game will be over.
Good luck :)

I added several important features like:
* 3 different levels,
* high score for each level(I used UserDefaults)
* high score list, 
* new game button, 
* new record label with info about your success,
* save your name if you break the record with 15 char limitation (I used UserDefaults), 
* 3 lives with graphic implementation - so game will be terminated if you lose your 3 lives or the number of rounds (50) will end, 
*simple app icon :)

### What We can learn from this code
