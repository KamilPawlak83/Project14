# Project14

This Project is my extension to Project14 from 100 Days of Swift by Paul Hudson: github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift/tree/main/Classic/project14.

I added several important features like:

3 different levels,
high score for each level(I used UserDefaults)
high score list, 
new game button, 
new record label with info about your success,
save your name if you break the record with 15 char limitation (I used UserDefaults), 
3 lives with graphic implementation - so game will be terminated if you lose your 3 lives or the number of rounds (50) will end, 
simple app icon :)

# To Do

I want to reorganized info about New Record - right now user don't know if he see button or label.

I want do add reset highscore Button (with biometric authentification).

I have some problems with first sound - In my opinion sometimes it is a little bit strange. What do you thing?

# You can help :)

If You have some ideas how to improve this app I am looking forward to your opinion.
It would be even better to work together :)
